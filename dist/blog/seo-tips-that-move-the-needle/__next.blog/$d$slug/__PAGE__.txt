        Before writing the tips themselves, it's worth grounding the goal. SEO isn't about tricks or chasing Google updates—it's about making your site the clearest, most useful answer to a real human question, then removing friction so search engines can recognize that clarity.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">1. Start With Search Intent, Not Keywords</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        One of the biggest SEO mistakes is treating keywords as the goal rather than a signal. A keyword is simply a proxy for intent. If you don't understand why someone is searching, ranking won't translate into traffic that converts.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Search intent generally falls into four buckets:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-slate-600 mb-6 space-y-2 ml-4">
        <li><strong>Informational</strong> (learn something)</li>
        <li><strong>Navigational</strong> (find a specific site or brand)</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial</strong> (research before buying)</li>
        <li><strong>Transactional</strong> (ready to take action)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="bg-brand-50 border-l-4 border-brand-500 p-4 my-6">
        <p class="text-slate-700 font-medium">
          <strong>Actionable takeaway:</strong> Define the job to be done behind every keyword before creating content. Write for the intent, then optimize for the keyword—not the other way around.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">2. Create One Truly Excellent Page Instead of Five Mediocre Ones</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        SEO rewards depth and authority far more than volume. Publishing multiple overlapping articles on similar topics often cannibalizes your own rankings and dilutes topical authority.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">3. Optimize for Humans First, Then Search Engines</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Modern SEO is largely a byproduct of good user experience. Metrics like time on page, scroll depth, and pogo-sticking (users quickly returning to search results) act as indirect quality signals.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">4. Build Internal Links With Intention</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        Internal linking is one of the most underutilized SEO levers—and one of the safest. It helps search engines understand which pages matter most, how topics relate to each other, and where authority should flow.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">5. Technical SEO: Fix the Bottlenecks, Don't Chase Perfection</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        You don't need a flawless technical setup to rank—but you do need to eliminate obvious friction.
      </p>

      <div class="my-10 rounded-xl overflow-hidden border border-slate-200">
        <img 
          src="/seo-example-website.png" 
          alt="Example of a well-optimized website with clear call-to-actions and professional design"
          class="w-full"
        />
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-slate-900 mt-10 mb-4">Final Thoughts: SEO Is a Long Game</h2>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
        SEO works best when treated as an asset, not a campaign. The highest-performing sites are built around clear intent, high-quality evergreen content, strong internal structure, and consistent incremental improvement.
      </p>
      <p class="text-slate-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed font-medium">
        The goal isn't to game search engines—it's to become the obvious answer.
